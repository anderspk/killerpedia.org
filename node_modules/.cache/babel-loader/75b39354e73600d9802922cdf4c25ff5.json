Bundy was convicted of Aggravated Kidnapping\r\n          after waiving a jury trial and received a 1-15 year sentence. He\r\n          escaped while in custody but was recaptured 6 days later. He escaped a\r\n          second time and fled to Tallahassee, Florida, staying at a rooming\r\n          house near the Florida State University Campus.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          During the early morning hours of Sunday, January 15, 1978, Bundy\r\n          entered the Chi Omega sorority house and brutally attacked four women\r\n          residing there. Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy were killed, and Kathy\r\n          Kleiner and Karen Chandler sustained serious injuries. Within\r\n          approximately an hour of the attacks in the Chi Omega house, Bundy\r\n          entered another home nearby and attacked a woman residing there,\r\n          Cheryl Thomas. All five women were university students. All were\r\n          bludgeoned repeatedly with a blunt weapon.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Bundy was identified by a resident returning home to the Sorority\r\n          House, just as he was leaving with a club in his hand. Lisa Levy and\r\n          Margaret Bowman were killed by strangulation after receiving severe\r\n          beatings with a length of a tree branch used as a club. Margaret\r\n          Bowman's skull was crushed and literally laid open. The attacker also\r\n          bit Lisa Levy with sufficient intensity to be identified as human bite\r\n          marks.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Bundy was arrested a month later in Pensacola. Of critical importance\r\n          was the testimony of two forensic dental experts who testified\r\n          concerning analysis of the bite mark left on the body of Lisa Levy.\r\n          The experts both expressed to the jury their opinion that the\r\n          indentations on the victim's body were left by the unique teeth of\r\n          Bundy. Bundy was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder,\r\n          three counts of attempted first-degree murder, and two counts of\r\n          burglary. For the two crimes of first-degree murder the trial judge\r\n          imposed sentences of death.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          On February 9, 1978, Kimberly Leach, age 12, was reported missing from\r\n          her junior high school in Lake City, Florida. Two months later, after\r\n          a large scale search, the Leach girl's partially decomposed body was\r\n          located in a wooded area near the Suwanee River.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          There were semen stains in the crotch of her panties found near the\r\n          body. Two Lake City Holiday Inn employees and a handwriting expert\r\n          established that Bundy had registered at the Lake City Holiday Inn the\r\n          day before her disappearance under another name. A school crossing\r\n          guard at the junior high school identified Bundy as leading a young\r\n          girl to a van on the morning of the disappearance.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Bundy was again convicted of murder and sentenced to death. This death\r\n          sentence to be carried out a decade later.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <style jsx>{`\r\n        .profile-container {\r\n          display: flex;\r\n          flex-direction: column;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        img {\r\n          align-self: center;\r\n        }\r\n      `}</style>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nKillerProfile.getInitialProps = async context => {\r\n  const killer = context.query.data;\r\n\r\n  console.log(\"output\", killer);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    killer\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default KillerProfile;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
